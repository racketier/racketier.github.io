Hi! My name is Brian Huang and I'm a CSE Ph.D. student at UCSC. Currently, my research interests lie broadly in network security and internet privacy. I'm very fortunate to be able to work with Prof. Ram. As of late, I've been doing some research into Deep Packet Inspection systems deployed in the real world. My goal is to be able to create a more secure and free internet. 

Outside of school, I love playing badminton, golf, and video games. Fun fact, I was the president of the UCSC Badminton Club during my undergrad! I've built a few pcs and keyboards, and I'm working on building a NAS. I'm also an avid foodie/cook!
