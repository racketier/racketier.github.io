Hi! My name is Brian Huang and I'm a CSE Ph.D. student at UCSC. Currently, my research interests lie broadly in network security and internet privacy. Outside of school, I love playing badminton, golf, and video games. Fun fact, I was the president of the UCSC Badminton Club during my undergrad! I've built a few pcs and keyboards, and I'm working on building a NAS. I'm also an avid foodie/cook!

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
