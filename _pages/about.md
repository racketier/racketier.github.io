# Background
Hi! My name is **Brian Huang**, and I’m a (soon-to-be) **EECS Ph.D. student** at UC Irvine. I graduated with a B.S. and honors from UC Santa Cruz where I was super fortunate to have been able to work with [**Prof. Ram Sundara Raman**](https://ramakrishnansr.com/).

# Research Interests
My current research lies broadly in the intersections of the areas of **network security, internet privacy/censorship, human computer interaction, and AI/ML**. 

At UCSC, I worked with [**Prof. Ram Sundara Raman**](https://ramakrishnansr.com/), where we investigated real-world DPI deployments and their impact on online security and censorship. I also worked in [**Prof. Katia Obrackza's**](https://cider.ucsc.edu/people/katia-obraczka/) lab, [**i-NRG**](https://inrg.engineering.ucsc.edu/), on real-world applications of [**Li-Fi**](https://lightlinks.co/). My goal is to develop strategies that **enhance internet freedom** while strengthening security measures.

# Hobbies & Interests
Outside of research, I enjoy playing badminton, golf, and video games. I also love building PCs and mechanical keyboards, and I’m currently working on building a NAS. Also, I’m an avid foodie and cook when I'm not too lazy.
