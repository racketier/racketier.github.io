# Background
Hi! My name is **Brian Huang**, and I’m a (soon-to-be) **CSE Ph.D. student**. I graduated with a B.S. and honors from UC Santa Cruz where I was super fortunate to have been able to work with [**Prof. Ram**](https://ramakrishnansr.com/).

# Research Interests
My current research lied broadly in the areas of **network security and internet privacy**. 

At UCSC, I worked with [**Prof. Ram**](https://ramakrishnansr.com/), where we investigated real-world DPI deployments and their impact on online security and censorship. My goal is to develop strategies that **enhance internet freedom** while strengthening security measures.

# Hobbies & Interests
Outside of research, I enjoy playing **badminton, golf, and video games**. I also love **building PCs and mechanical keyboards**, and I’m currently working on building a **NAS**. Additionally, I’m an **avid foodie and cook**.
